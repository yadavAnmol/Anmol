      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <u>Anmol Yadav</u>, a passionate third-year Electronics &
        Telecommunication Engineering student from Lokmanya Tilak College of
        Engineering, Thane, Maharashtra. I'm always curious about how things
        work — from hardware circuits to the logic behind software applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests lie in both hardware and software development. Whether it's
        building an Arduino-based automation system or designing a dynamic
        website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — I enjoy turning ideas into
        real projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I’m a creative soul. I love drawing, painting, and
        enjoy playing cricket and carrom during my free time. I believe these
        hobbies help me stay balanced and inspired.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m still exploring my long-term career goals, but one thing I know for
        sure — I’m hardworking, curious, and always ready to learn something
        new. I enjoy taking on challenges that help me grow personally and
        professionally.
      </p>
      <p>
