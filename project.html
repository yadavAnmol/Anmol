          <h3>Water Level Indicator</h3>
          <p>
            My first-year project detects the water level in a tank. As the tank fills up, a buzzer starts beeping when the water reaches the top level, indicating the tank is full.

          <h3>Automatic Water Level Controller</h3>
          <p>
            Built in 2nd year (Sem 3), this model uses an IC555 timer to automatically control water flow. The system starts the pump when the water is below the lower level, and stops it when it reaches the high (threshold) level.

          <h3>Railway Track Crack Detection</h3>
          <p>
            A smart model using Arduino UNO to detect cracks on railway tracks. Sensors monitor the track, and data is sent to the Blynk IoT platform for real-time display and analysis.
